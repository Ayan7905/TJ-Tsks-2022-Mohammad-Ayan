In order to create a form first i use the form tag and gave its id as register
after that to take inputs i useed input tags and mention their types as needed and also specify their ids so that i can use them later to customize their look.
After i have done all my inputs feilds i closed the html and moved on to the css for customization of form.
There i face some problems about styling tags and other things there i used google,sometime youtube
and completed the project.
Thank you.
